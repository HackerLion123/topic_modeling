# Bert Topic 



## *Steps*

1. Generate Embeddings

2. Dimensionality Reduction

3. Clustering

4. Vectorizers

5. c-TF-IDF

In order to get an accurate representation of the topics from our bag-of-words matrix, TF-IDF was adjusted to work on a cluster/categorical/topic level instead of a document level. This adjusted TF-IDF representation is called c-TF-IDF and takes into account what makes the documents in one cluster different from documents in another cluster.

6. Fine-tune Topics
